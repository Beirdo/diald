Users of the diald-top program (a third party dctrl like program
with text displays) and old versions of dctrl should note that
their connection lists are confusing in that they list destination
and source columns.

  For 2.1 kernels and above (which have AF_PACKET support) the
first column is the address on *this* side of the managed link
and the second column is the address on the *remote* side of
the managed link.

  For 2.0 kernels (which do not have AF_PACKET support) there
is no way to easily determine which way packets are going and
which address is which. Therefore the first column is the
numerically lowest of the source and destination addresses on
the connection and the second column is the numerically highest.

  Packets are actually flowing both ways on the connection and we
do not consider which end inititiated the connection. Therefore
the idea of source and destination is meaningless. Sorry :-).
