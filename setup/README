                    Example Diald Setup Scripts
                    ---------------------------

IMPORTANT
---------

This is what I use. It may not work for you. It may need changing
to work on whatever distribution you are using. It may be complete
overkill for you. You it at your own risk.

Corrections and additions (modem dial scripts, ISP login scripts
etc.) are welcome.


INSTALLATION
------------

Everything below this directory is laid out exactly as it appears
under / on my system. You _could_ do "cp -a etc usr /" if you
wished - as long as you have first checked to make sure nothing
important will be overwritten and that the two startup scripts
in etc/init.d will end up in the right place and do the right
thing. I recommend you read and understand everything thoroughly
first and then decide whether or not you actually want to try
and use this.


START/STOP SCRIPTS
------------------

1. etc/init.d/ippp

   Starts and stops ippp interfaces and their supporting ipppd
   daemons. This script reads config information from etc/ippp.conf
   which tells it what ipppd daemons to run on what interfaces.

   Usage: etc/init.d/ippp start | stop [ link ... ]

   If no links are specified then all listed in etc/ippp.conf
   will be started or stopped.

2. etc/init.d/diald

   Starts and stops diald daemons. This script reads config
   information from directories under etc/diald for each link.

   Usage: etc/init.d/diald start | stop [ link ... ]

   If no links are specified then all found under etc/diald
   will be started or stopped.


LOCAL CONFIGURATION
-------------------

1. etc/ippp.conf

   Defines the ippp interfaces which are to be configured and
   the necessary ipppd daemons needed to support them. Each line
   specifies an instance of ipppd and what ippp interfaces it
   is to manage. If you have links (especially bidirectional
   links) that require different ipppd options (such as names
   for authentication) you probably need more than one ipppd.
   The EAZ/MSN specified here is used when the link is inactive
   so that it will accept incoming connections. If you want a
   link to be outgoing only you can use "-" in this field.

2. etc/diald/device.conf

   This defines how devices are dialled. The device type field
   may give a specific device as used in a diald config or may
   give a "generic" device. The standard connect script
   usr/share/diald/connect knows the generic type of most
   devices you are likely to need. The dial method field
   specifies a script under usr/share/diald that may be used
   to dial the given device.

3. etc/diald/.../

   Directories containing the configuration for each diald
   managed link. Each directory represents one link and
   contains a "config" file and a "link" file. The "config"
   file contains the diald config for the link. The "link"
   file gives parameters to be used by the connect script
   and the device specific dial scripts. Other files
   required by entries in the "config" file may also be
   present in these directories.


GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
--------------------

Global configuration is stored in "/usr/share/diald/".

1. usr/share/diald/connect
   usr/share/diald/disconnect

   The standard scripts used to connect and disconnect a
   link. These are driven by configuration information
   from "/etc/diald/device.conf" and "/etc/diald/.../link"
   so should not need changing.

2. usr/share/diald/modem

   Contains scripts for dialling modems. The script used for
   a particular device is determined by "/etc/diald/device.conf"
   which is read by the standard connect script. Note that the
   dial scripts only dial the remote site but DO NOT login.
   If a dial script has a twin with a ".hangup" extension
   this will be used by the standard disconnect script to
   hangup a connection. This is not normally needed.

3. usr/share/diald/isdn
   usr/share/diald/isdn.hangup

   Used to dial and hangup isdn links. The isdn script is
   selected through "/etc/diald/device.conf" just as with
   modems.

4. usr/share/diald/login

   Contains login scripts used for authenticating and starting
   the remote pppd (if necessary). Login scripts are run by
   the standard connect script after a connection is established
   but before it exits and allows diald to start pppd. The login
   script to use is selected via LOGIN="..." parameters in
   "/etc/diald/.../link" and may be device specific. If no login
   script is specified the connect script will simply exit once
   the connection has been established using the dial script.
   If the remote pppd starts automatically and you use PAP or
   CHAP for authentication you would not need a login script.
